# Project Progression and Milestones

## First Thoughts

- How do LLMs parse images ? What is the pipeline?
- How to send images through the API?
- Processing images seem to be slower than text, and more expensive. How to optimize costs?
- What are the best practices for image preprocessing before sending to the API?
- Should the agents have memory when dealing with images?

## TODOs

- [ ] Research and document the image processing pipeline for LLMs.
